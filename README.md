## Overview

1. Applying the best development practices to develop the status and health check endpoints for a TechTrends application.

2. Packaging the TechTrends application by creating a Dockerfile and Docker image.

3. Implementing the Continuous Integration practices, by using GitHub Actions to automate the build and push of the Docker image to DockerHub.

4. Constructing the Kubernetes declarative manifests to deploy TechTrends to a sandbox namespace within a Kubernetes cluster. The cluster should be provisioned using k3s in a vagrant box.

5. Templating the Kubernetes manifests using a Helm chart and provide the input configuration files for staging and production environments.

6. Implementing the Continuous Delivery practices, by deploying the TechTrends application to staging and production environments using ArgoCD and the Helm chart.
